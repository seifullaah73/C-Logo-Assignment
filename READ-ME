Logo Design Software Assignment using C++
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was part of my assignment to create a C++ program via a terminal; no GUI's used, to develop a LOGO like software, which
reads some commands from a text file, processes it, renders it using graphics library on a separate window.

I recommend opening Final.cbp using codeblocks, which is free to download from the main site.

You will need to insert commands into the provided text file called command.txt

The format of the codes are as follows:

Commands 
---------
FORWARD X - This draws a line of x amount in the direction the cursor is facing e.g. FORWARD 10

LEFT Y - Rotates the cursor by x degrees to the left e.g. LEFT 90

REPEAT Z [ COMMAND ] - Repeats the command in the bracket Z amount of times e.g. REPEAT 4 [ FORWARD 10 LEFT 90 ] 
                       this will draw a square 10 units length.

JUMP X - moves cursor forward by X amount without drawing any line e.g. JUMP 10


Operate
--------
Ideal to open using codeblocks, open the final.cbp file.
